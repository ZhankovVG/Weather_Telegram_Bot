## About the project

The bot can display the weather for today and two days ahead. Displays weather: date and date, city, temperature, humidity, pressure, wind, sunrise, sunset and day length. The weather forecast button for 2 days is also implemented. There are also emoticons that display the weather outside the window. And I also want to implement in the future a button to call the weather of the last entry of the city and more, and it will also be possible to add a reminder to view the weather every 2 days so as not to bother or 1 time per day.
